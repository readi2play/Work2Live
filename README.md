A simple addon to allow easy one-click access to all your professions

## What is this for?

This addon is intended to provide a single button one can click on to easily open any profession's window. 

## Why not just using the default UI?

Sure the default UI of dragonflight is neat and handy. But the professions book didn't change at all. It is there and present, but most people tend to pull their professions onto dedicated action bar buttons to open 'em in one click. This is space consuming and needs to be done over and over again when starting a new toon.

## Why not just using a macro?

I already did this in style of a macro, but in fact the handling is quite bulky if one wants to cover all professions of all of his toons. I ended up with having a global macro that `/click` certain action bar buttons if used with a couple of modifiers. This also is semi optimal because of the down sides of this approach.

- hard character limit of user macros (even with Macro Addons)
- needs to be done over and over again when starting a new toon
- needs nearly a whole action bar only for this
